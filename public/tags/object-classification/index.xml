      <description>Introduction This post is aimed at providing some additional background into the Plane Spotting Object Detection/Classification demo that I recently built and uploaded to GitHub.
Latest code is available here.
There is a web demo available here.
The demo is composed of a website that allows you to upload the image of a plane and receive the same image with bounding boxes around the planes it detects and the airline they belong to.</description>
